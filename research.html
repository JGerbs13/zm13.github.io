<p>I work with my advisor, Caty Pilachowski, at Indiana University researching the abundance of light elements, from F to Ca, with a focus on the odd elements. The odd elements have poorly known abundances and are likely not formed by primary processes such as He through Si burning, but due to secondary processes, such as proton capture. To explore these abundances we use infrared spectroscopy of both atomic features and molecular lines. </p>

<p>
Chlorine has two stable isotopes; (35)Cl is thought to be produced when (34)S captures a proton and the other isotope, (37)Cl is thought to be produced from radioactive decay of (37)Ar. Measurements of chlorine abundances in stellar atmospheres are extremely difficult and little empirical data are available to compare with Cl evolution models. The solar Cl abundance in particular highlights the difficulties in Cl abundance measurements; no chlorine abundance measurement is possible from the quiet photosphere. However, HCl molecular vibro-rotational lines appear in the L-Band for stars with effective temperatures lower than 4000K. We targeted those lines to determine abundances in M and K type stars.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I have reduced and measured Cl (plus C, O, Si, Ca, and K) abundances in thin disk stars observed with the Kitt Peak 4m telescope in 2014-2015, using a high resolution infrared spectrometer. Further observations are planned to extend our sample.
